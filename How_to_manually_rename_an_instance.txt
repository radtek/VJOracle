1)  If using spfile:
	Issue the following command to dump the spfile into an init.ora file:
		SQL> create pfile='rename_instance' from spfile;
    	Edit the init parameter file and change all references to the old instance name and put the new instance name in the file 
	(instance_name, instance_number, thread, undo_tablespace)
	Another way to update the spfile for each instance would be, you would have to do this for each init parameter:
		alter system set instance_name='VCSTST5A' scope=spfile sid='vcstst5a';
    If using init.ora
    	Edit the init parameter file and change all references to the old instance name and put the new instance name in the file 
	(instance_name, instance_number, thread, undo_tablespace)


2) Stop all services related to the instance

SQL> shutdown database

3) rename the file orapwd and init.ora file and modify oratab, .ora_<INSTANCE_NAME>, tnsnames entry, and the listener file according to the new instance entry

I had to rename orapwd and init.ora (I did not rename the temporary init.ora file that was created if using an spfile, 
but the one with the spfile location in it was renamed) and modified tnsnames.ora

4) Then use srvctl to remove the instance.

srvctl remove instance -d vcstst5 -i vcstst52

5) Then use srvctl to add the instance:

srvctl add instance -d vcstst5 -i vcstst5a -n uddcbddev10

6)  Start all the services.

If using spfile:
	SQL> startup pfile='rename_instance' 
	SQL> create spfile='+VCSTST5/vcstst5/spfilevcstst5.ora' from pfile='rename_instance';
	SQL> shutdown immediate   (Did this on both servers to verify)
	SQL> startup              (Did this on both servers to verify)
If using init.ora:
	SQL> startup

7)  Go into Grid Control remove the instance and then add a new instance.
	Targets -> Databases -> Find the cluster database name and then hit configure.
	Select the old instance name under instances and hit remove -> next -> submit -> ok.
	Targets -> Databases -> Find the cluster database name and then hit configure.
	Under Instances hit add (modify Instance Name, Database SID, and any other parameters) -> ok -> next -> submit -> ok.


Additional Notes:

 
I have changed my spfile with alter system set <parameter_name> =.... scope=spfile. The spfile is on ASM storage and the database will not start.
How to recover: 
 

In $ORACLE_HOME/dbs

. oraenv <instance_name>

sqlplus "/ as sysdba" 

startup nomount

create pfile='recoversp' from spfile 
/
shutdown immediate
quit
 
Now edit the newly created pfile to change the parameter to something sensible.

Then:
 
sqlplus "/ as sysdba"

startup pfile='recoversp' (or whatever you called it in step one).
 
create spfile='+DATA/GASM/spfileGASM.ora' from pfile='recoversp' 
/
N.B.The name of the spfile is in your original init<instance_name>.ora so adjust to suit

shutdown immediate
startup
quit
