RMAN Duplicaiton
RMAN has the ability to duplicate, or clone, a database from a backup or from an active database. It is possible to create a duplicate database on a remote server with the same file structure,

Source database:
    Database name: PRDHR1
    Single instance
    Version: 11.2.0.2
    Hostname: vorcprdhr1
    Filesystem: regular (/ora_db/prdhr1)

Target database:
    Database name: TSTHR2 (AUXILIARY database)
    Single instance
    Version: 11.2.0.2
    ORACLE_HOME: /apps/oracle/product/11.2.0/db_1
    Hostname: vorctsthr2
    Filesystem: regular (/ora_db/tsthr2) 

PREPARATION STEPS:
 
At Target Server:
1) Set environment for Target database (Tsthr2)
    ~oracle/.ora_tsthr2

2) Make sure connectivity to Source and Target database as sys
    sqlplus sys/xxxxx@target as sysdba
    sqlplus sys/xxxxx@source as sysdba

3) Test TNSPING to both Target and Source databases
     Tnsping Source
    Tnsping Target

4) Make sure passwordfile for Target database exists (tsthr2). If one do not exists for target database create one
     $orapwd file=$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/orapwtsthr2 password=xxxxx entries=10

5) Add db_file_name_convert parameter to pfile
    db_file_name_convert=('/ora_db/prdhr1','/ora_db/tsthr2')
    log_file_name_convert=('/ora_db/prdhr1','/ora_db/tsthr2')

6) Make sure source and target datafile structure is same

7) Startup Auxilary database in nomount state.
    startup nomount;

-- Follow Active Database Duplicaiton or Backup-Based Duplicaiton Steps (Steps 8-9)

10) Shutdown and restart Target database (Tsthr2) in non-archivelog mode
    Shutdown immediate;
    Startup mount;
    alter database noarchivelog;
    alter database open;
    archive log list;

 Active Database Duplication

Oracle 11g introduced the ability to create duplicate databases directly without the need for a backup. This is known as active database duplication. The process is similar to the backup-based duplication, with a few exceptions.
First, and most obviously, you don't need a backup of the source system, but it does have to be in ARCHIVELOG mode.
The passwords in the password files must match for both servers, so remember to set the correct password when creating the password file on the destination server.
Both the source and destination database servers require a "tnsnames.ora" entry for the destination database. In this case I added the following to each server. The destination server still requires the source entry shown in the previous section.


8) Make connection to Source and Target databases via RMAN.
    rman target sys/xxx@prdhr1 auxiliary sys/xxxxx@tsthr190 log=tsthr2_refresh_from_prdhr1.log
        --Here target database specified is Source database and Auxiliary is Target

9) Run Database duplication command within RMAN
    duplicate target database to tsthr2  from active database;

Backup-Based Duplication
    --Tape based duplication
	--startup taget(aux) database
	startup nomount;

	--run duplicate database
	rman TARGET sys/xxxxxx@prdhr1 auxiliary /

	RMAN> run {
	    set until time "to_date('17-Mar-2014 08:00:00','dd-Mon-yyyy hh24:mi:ss')";
	    allocate auxiliary  channel ch1 type 'sbt_tape' parms 'ENV=(NB_ORA_SERVER=uddcbpnbu01bk.mkcorp.com,NB_ORA_CLIENT=vorcprdhr1bk.mkcorp.com)';
	    DUPLICATE DATABASE TO TSTHR2;
		}

     --Disk based backup duplication
	





We can then duplicate the database using one of the following commands.

    # Backup files are in matching location to that on the source server.
    # Duplicate database to TARGET's current state.
    DUPLICATE TARGET DATABASE TO DB11G
      SPFILE
      NOFILENAMECHECK;

    # Duplicate database to TARGET's state 4 days ago.
    DUPLICATE TARGET DATABASE TO DB11G
      UNTIL TIME 'SYSDATE-4'
      SPFILE
      NOFILENAMECHECK;

    # Backup files are in a different location to that on the source server.
    # Duplicate database to the most recent state possible using the provided backups.
    # Works with just an AUXILIARY connection only.
    DUPLICATE DATABASE TO DB11G
      SPFILE
      BACKUP LOCATION '/source/app/oracle/fast_recovery_area/DB11G'
      NOFILENAMECHECK;
