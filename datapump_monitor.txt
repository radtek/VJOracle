SYSTEM     SYS_EXPORT_FULL_01  EXPORT    FULL      NOT RUNNING        0

Step 2. Ensure that the listed jobs in dba_datapump_jobs are not export/import Data Pump jobs that are active: status should be 'NOT RUNNING'.

Step 3. Check with the job owner that the job with status 'NOT RUNNING' in dba_datapump_jobs is not an export/import Data Pump job that has been temporary stopped, but is actually a job that failed. (E.g. the full database export job by SYSTEM is not a job that failed, but was deliberately paused with STOP_JOB).

Step 4. Determine in SQL*Plus the related master tables:
-- locate Data Pump master tables:

SELECT o.status, o.object_id, o.object_type, 
       o.owner||'.'||object_name "OWNER.OBJECT"
  FROM dba_objects o, dba_datapump_jobs j
 WHERE o.owner=j.owner_name AND o.object_name=j.job_name
   AND j.job_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%' ORDER BY 4,2;

STATUS   OBJECT_ID OBJECT_TYPE  OWNER.OBJECT
------- ---------- ------------ -------------------------
VALID        85283 TABLE        SCOTT.EXPDP_20051121
VALID        85215 TABLE        SCOTT.SYS_EXPORT_TABLE_02
VALID        85162 TABLE        SYSTEM.SYS_EXPORT_FULL_01

Step 5. For jobs that were stopped in the past and won't be restarted anymore, delete the master table. E.g.:
DROP TABLE scott.sys_export_table_02;

Step 6. Re-run the query on dba_datapump_jobs and dba_objects (step 1 and 4). If there are still jobs listed in dba_datapump_jobs, and these jobs do not have a master table anymore, cleanup the job while connected as the job owner. E.g.:
CONNECT scott/tiger
SET serveroutput on
SET lines 100
DECLARE
   h1 NUMBER;
BEGIN
   h1 := DBMS_DATAPUMP.ATTACH('SYS_EXPORT_TABLE_01','SCOTT');
   DBMS_DATAPUMP.STOP_JOB (h1);
END;
/

Note that after the call to the STOP_JOB procedure, it may take some time for the job to be removed. Query the view user_datapump_jobs to check whether the job has been removed:
SELECT * FROM user_datapump_jobs;

Step 7. Confirm that the job has been removed:
CONNECT / as sysdba

COL job_name FORMAT a20 
COL state FORMAT a11  
COL operation LIKE state
